# Photographer UI
This is an example of Website UI for Photographers with Black &amp; White accent based on free design by NicePage, and developed by myself. I created this Example of Photographer Portfolio Website UI with pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript with addition of skrollr.js by Prinzhorn to apply fade-in effect as the page is scrolling down.
